# What is a data transfer plan?

Data transfer plans are easy to use and charged at affordable prices. A data transfer plan immediately takes effect upon purchase. It is used to deduct IPv4 data usage that is generated by certain instances until the data transfer plan is consumed or expired. Applicable instances are Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances, Elastic IP addresses, Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instances, and EIP bandwidth plans that are billed on a pay-by-traffic basis. Data transfer plans are not applicable to IPv4 data usage generated by Elastic IP addresses of BGP \(Multi-ISP\)\_Pro.

## Benefits

-   Cost-effectiveness

    Data transfer plans are charged at affordable prices.

-   Wide service scope

    Data transfer plans can be used to deduct the data usage generated by ECS instances, Elastic IP addresses, SLB instances, and EIP bandwidth plans.

-   Ease of use

    After your purchased data transfer plan is activated, it is automatically used to deduct the data usage generated by the corresponding services in multiple regions. No manual configuration is required. For more information, see [Purchase data transfer plans](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Purchase data transfer plans.md).

-   Unified management

    Based on the usage of your data transfer plans, you can easily verify the total Internet data usage.
