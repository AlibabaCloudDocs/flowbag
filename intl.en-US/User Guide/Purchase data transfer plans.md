# Purchase data transfer plans

Data transfer plans are easy to use and charged at affordable prices. A data transfer plan immediately takes effect upon purchase. It is used to deduct IPv4 data usage that is generated by certain instances until the data transfer plan is consumed or expired. Applicable instances are Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances, EIP, Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instances, and EIP bandwidth plans that are billed on a pay-by-traffic basis. Data transfer plans are not applicable to IPv4 data usage generated by Elastic IP addresses of BGP \(Multi-ISP\)\_Pro.

Before you purchase a data transfer plan, pay close attention to the following issues:

-   Each account can hold up to 70 active data transfer plans, and the quota cannot be increased. Select an appropriate data transfer plan size.
-   Each data transfer plan covers an area and the area covers one or more regions. The relation between areas and regions is displayed in the following table.

|Area|Region|

|China Mainland|China \(Qingdao\), China \(Beijing\), China \(Zhangjiakou-Beijing Winter Olympics\), China \(Hohhot\), China \(Hangzhou\), China \(Shanghai\), and China \(Shenzhen\)|
